🌟 Introduction to Stacks 🌟

🚀 Stacks - The Building Blocks of LIFO Operations 🚀

🔍 What is a Stack? A Stack is a collection of elements with two principal operations: 
🔹 Push: Add an item to the top of the stack. 
🔹 Pop: Remove the item from the top of the stack. Stacks operate on a Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning the last item added is the first one to be removed.

🔹 Stack vs. Queue: Key Differences 
📍 Order of Operations: Stack: Last In, First Out (LIFO) Queue: First In, First Out (FIFO)

📍 Usage: Stack: Useful for scenarios like undo mechanisms, expression evaluation, and backtracking. Queue: Useful for tasks like scheduling, buffering, and managing resources in a first-come, first-served manner.

🔹 Key Operations: 🔸 Push: Time: O(1) Space: O(1) 🔸 Pop: Time: O(1) Space: O(1) 🔸 Peek (Top): Time: O(1) Space: O(1) 🔸 Is Empty: Time: O(1) Space: O(1)

🔹 Key Considerations:

⚠ Corner Cases: Empty Stack: Attempting to pop or peek from an empty stack can lead to errors or exceptions.

🔹 Approaches: 🔄 Stack Implementation: 🔸 Array-based: Fixed size, can be inefficient in dynamic scenarios. 🔸 Linked List-based: Flexible size, efficient for dynamic usage.

🔹 Applications of Stacks: 🔸 Function Call Management: Used in managing function calls and recursion. 🔸 Expression Evaluation: Essential for parsing and evaluating expressions (e.g., infix, postfix). 🔸 Undo Mechanisms: Implemented in editors and applications for undo functionality. 🔸 Backtracking Algorithms: Useful in algorithms that explore all possible solutions.

🔥 Pro Tip: Stacks are fundamental in many algorithms and systems, making them crucial for understanding and solving complex problems efficiently. Mastering stack operations will enhance your ability to tackle a variety of computational challenges.
