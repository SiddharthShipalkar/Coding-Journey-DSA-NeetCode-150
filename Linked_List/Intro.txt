🌟 Introduction to Linked Lists 🌟

🚀 Linked Lists - The Foundation of Dynamic Data Structures 🚀

🔍 What is a Linked List?
A Linked List is a sequence of nodes where each node contains:
🔹 Data: The value or information.
🔹 Next Pointer: A reference to the next node in the sequence.
   Unlike arrays, linked lists provide flexibility in memory allocation,
   allowing efficient insertion and deletion operations.

🔹 Linked List vs. Array: 
Key Differences
📍 Data Structure:
Linked List: Non-contiguous
Array: Contiguous
📍 Memory Allocation:
Linked List: Allocated one by one to individual elements.
Array: Allocated to the whole array.
📍 Insertion/Deletion:
Linked List: Efficient
Array: Inefficient
📍 Access:
Linked List: Sequential
Array: Random


🔹 Linked List Variants:
🔸 Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node.
🔸 Doubly Linked List: Nodes have pointers to both the next and previous nodes.
🔸 Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a loop.


🔹 Key Operations:
🔍 Access/Search:
Time: O(n) | Ω(n)
Space: O(1)
🔄 Insertion/Deletion:
Time: O(1) at the head/tail; O(n) at a specific position | Ω(1) at head/tail, Ω(n) at specific position.
Space: O(1)
🔁 Reversing a Linked List:
Time: O(n) | Ω(n)
Space: O(1)

🔹 Key Considerations:

⚠ Corner Cases:
Empty Linked List: The head is null.
Single Node: Operations may differ in complexity.

🔹 Approaches:
🔄 Two-Pointer Technique:
🔸 Finding the kth from Last Node: Use two pointers; the first pointer is advanced by k nodes. 
    When it reaches the end, the second pointer will be at the kth node from the end.
🔸 Detecting Cycles: Use two pointers moving at different speeds; if they meet, a cycle exists.
🔸 Finding the Middle Node: Move one pointer twice as fast as the other. When the faster pointer 
    reaches the end, the slower pointer will be at the middle.

🔹 Applications of Linked Lists:
🔸 Implementing Stacks and Queues: Efficiently manage these data structures.
🔸 Handling Collisions in Hash Tables: Use linked lists for chaining in hash tables.
🔸 Representing Graphs: Use for adjacency lists in graph representation.
🔸 Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allocate and deallocate memory dynamically.

🔥 Pro Tip: Linked lists are versatile and can be adapted for various use cases in programming. 
            Understanding their core principles will enhance your problem-solving skills and data structure knowledge.
